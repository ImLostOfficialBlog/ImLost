  <h1>I asked some teens about the election, here are their thoughts.</h1>
  <br></br>
<p>For context, the 2020 United States Presedential Election was a U.S. election with the two canidates being Donald Trump of the GOP, and Joe Biden of the Democratic Party. It  resulted in Joe Biden becoming the 46th president of the U.S. I find that RARMSTAR did a good job of explaining the election, so if you don't know how the election went I recommend watching his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btdn0COjjqU">video</a> on it.</p>
<p>The first person I interview has asked for me to refer to them as anonymous. Yesterday I started my interview with anonymous by asking "how do you feel about the 2020 presidential elections" I also asked if they could answer in two to three sentences, here was their response. "It. Was. Rigged." Very descriptive, right? So I moved on to my next question, how do they feel about president Biden's campaign. Anonymous's reply was, "I feel like the 2020 election was unfair. Biden won because of fake mail in ballots and Trump literally had everything against him. Bidens campaign is horrible, he doesn't even know what he is saying. When he says he is going to do something he does the complete opposite. He probably has dementia and he chose the WORST POSSIBLE CANDIDATE YOU CAN CHOOSE IN A PRESIDENTIAL RACE." I would like to go through what is fact and what is fake in this reply. To start "I feel like the 2020 election was unfair." I can not say anything about this because this is anonymous's opinion. but saying that Biden won because of mail in ballot fraud is a falsehood, there is no proof of mass mail in ballot fraud. Most of this is opinion so I will skip over it for now. "He probably has dementia or something" I know quite a few people who beleive this, but that statement hasn't been completely back by physicians (at the time of this writing). For his final statement I believe "anomymous" is refering to Biden selecting Kamala Harris as a V.P. this statement is also is opinionated so i will not talk about it.
