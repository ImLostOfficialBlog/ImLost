  <h1>I asked some teens about the election, here are their thoughts.</h1>
  <br></br>
<p>For context, the 2020 United States Presedential Election was a U.S. election with the two canidates being Donald Trump of the GOP, and Joe Biden of the Democratic Party. It  resulted in Joe Biden becoming the 46th president of the U.S. I find that RARMSTAR did a good job of explaining the election, so if you don't know how the election went I recommend watching his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btdn0COjjqU">video</a> on it.</p>
<p>The first person I interview has asked for me to refer to them as Anonymous. Yesterday I started my interview with Anonymous by asking "how do you feel about the 2020 presidential elections" I also asked if they could answer in two to three sentences, here was their response. "It. Was. Rigged." Very descriptive, right? So I moved on to my next question, how do they feel about president Biden's campaign. Anonymous's reply was, "I feel like the 2020 election was unfair. Biden won because of fake mail in ballots and Trump literally had everything against him. Bidens campaign is horrible, he doesn't even know what he is saying. When he says he is going to do something he does the complete opposite. He probably has dementia and he chose the WORST POSSIBLE CANDIDATE YOU CAN CHOOSE IN A PRESIDENTIAL RACE." I would like to go through what is fact and what is fake in this reply. To start "I feel like the 2020 election was unfair." I can not say anything about this because this is Anonymous's opinion. but saying that Biden won because of mail in ballot fraud is a falsehood, there is no proof of mass mail in ballot fraud. Most of this is opinion so I will skip over it for now. "He probably has dementia or something" I know quite a few people who beleive this, but that statement hasn't been completely backed by physicians (at the time of this writing). For his final statement I believe Anonymous is refering to Biden selecting Kamala Harris as a V.P., this statement is also opinionated so I will not talk about it.</p>
<p>The next person I interviewed has asked to be called Ash. Ash answered only one question, with great length. He responded with the following. "I'm not much of a political person, however the election was a drag since Trump almost got impeached, Biden's vows about decency and unifying the nation (like healing or something), etc. Trump fought viciously to remain in the white house, which I can understand his position, and how Biden got the most votes in all of American history was amazing and I didn't think Biden would win based on his vows. Biden's campaign was worth it in the end, I guess. Showing his promises and why he wants to be the president, I feel his campaign was critical and it had shamed Trump's actions while he was president. I will only briefly touch on this for the sake of this article's length. I agree with most of what is said, and from what I've seen, alot of people are angry that time was wasted to attempt to impeach Donald Trump since the election was nearing.</p>
How do you feel about the 2020 election: I feel like trump was a good president just beacuase he was very straight forward but the things he said was a little fucked. the election was a little weird tho beacuse some places seemed to be cheating but thats not conformed for sure. anyways, today joe biden is kinda senile and weird. aka all the memes of him stuttering words and stuff. maybe it should have been trump but i dont know.
