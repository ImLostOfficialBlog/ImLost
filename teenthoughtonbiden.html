  <h1>I asked some teens about the election, here are their thoughts.</h1>
  <br></br>
<p>For context, the 2020 United States Presedential Election was a U.S. election with the two canidates being Donald Trump of the GOP, and Joe Biden of the Democratic Party. It  resulted in Joe Biden becoming the 46th president of the U.S. I find that RARMSTAR did a good job of explaining the election, so if you don't know how the election went I recommend watching his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btdn0COjjqU">video</a> on it.</p>
