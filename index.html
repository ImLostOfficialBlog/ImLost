<h1>I'm Lost.</h1>
<p>Alright. Lets get this straight, this is not in anyway about my opinions. I made this blog because I wanted people to see how the teen demographic saw the world. So i'm going around and interviewing teenagers about politics, albeit mainly U.S politics. So here I will share my findings, I hope you find it somewhat interesting.</p>
